# Python-Award-Option by Mr Ssemwanga

### Overview

This is a Python programming course I have set up for students who have not taken programming lessons at GCSE but want skills to prepare them for Post-18 studies

### Programme of Study

1. **Introduction to Python Programming**
   - Provides a solid foundation in Python syntax and basic programming concepts.
2. **Control Structures**
   - Teaches how to use loops and conditional statements to control the flow of a program.
3. **Functions and Modules**
   - Covers the creation and use of functions and modules to write reusable and organised code.
4. **Data Structures**
   - Introduces lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples, essential for managing collections of data.
5. **Validation and Error Handling**
   - Focuses on writing robust code by handling errors and validating input.
6. **File Handling**
   - Explains how to read from and write to files, a crucial skill for many applications.
7. **Basics of Object-Oriented Programming**
   - Introduces the principles of OOP, including classes and objects, to model real-world entities.
8. **Version Control**
   - Teaches the basics of version control using Git, essential for collaborative development and provides an online repository to showcase skills
9. **Python and Database Integration**
   - Covers how to connect Python applications to databases to store and retrieve data.
10. **Working with Jupyter Notebooks**
    - Demonstrates how to use Jupyter Notebooks for interactive coding and data analysis.

### Justification

This programme of study forms a strong foundation for students' programming skills post-18 studies for several reasons:

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: The topics cover essential programming concepts and skills that are fundamental to any further study or career in computer science.
- **Practical Skills**: Students will learn practical skills such as file handling, database integration, and version control, which are directly applicable in real-world scenarios.
- **Problem-Solving**: By learning control structures, functions, and error handling, students will develop strong problem-solving abilities.
- **Preparation for Advanced Topics**: The basics of object-oriented programming and data structures prepare students for more advanced topics they will encounter in university courses.
- **Interactive Learning**: Working with Jupyter Notebooks provides an interactive and engaging way to learn and experiment with code.
