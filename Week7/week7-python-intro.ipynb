    "### Week 7: Basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lesson Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "- Learn how to define and use classes and objects.\n",
    "- Explore key concepts such as attributes, methods, constructors, and encapsulation.\n",
    "- Create Python programs using classes to model real-world entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n",
    "- OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which represent real-world entities.\n",
    "- Objects have **attributes** (characteristics) and **methods** (behaviors).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Classes and Objects:\n",
    "- A **class** is a blueprint / template for creating objects.\n",
    "- An **object** is an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Defining a Class**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Car:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, brand, model, year):\n",
    "            self.brand = brand  # Attribute\n",
    "            self.model = model\n",
    "            self.year = year\n",
    "\n",
    "        def start_engine(self):  # Method\n",
    "            print(f\"The {self.brand} {self.model} engine has started.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Creating an object (instance) of the Car class\n",
    "    my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\n",
    "    print(my_car.brand)  # Output: Toyota\n",
    "    my_car.start_engine()  # Output: The Toyota Corolla engine has started.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Attributes and Methods:\n",
    "- **Attributes**: Variables that store information about an object.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Student:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "            self.name = name\n",
    "            self.age = age\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methods**: Functions defined within a class that perform actions.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Dog:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "            self.name = name\n",
    "        \n",
    "        def bark(self):\n",
    "            print(f\"{self.name} is barking!\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. The `__init__` Method (Constructor):\n",
    "- The `__init__` method initializes objects when they are created.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Person:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "            self.name = name\n",
    "            self.age = age\n",
    "        \n",
    "        def introduce(self):\n",
    "            print(f\"My name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "    person1.introduce()  # Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Encapsulation:\n",
    "- Encapsulation means bundling data (attributes) and methods together while restricting direct access to some attributes.\n",
    "- **Example** (using private attributes):\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class BankAccount:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",
    "            self.__account_number = account_number  # Private attribute\n",
    "            self.__balance = balance\n",
    "\n",
    "        def get_balance(self):\n",
    "            return self.__balance\n",
    "\n",
    "        def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "            if amount > 0:\n",
    "                self.__balance += amount\n",
    "                print(f\"Deposited {amount}. New balance: {self.__balance}\")\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                print(\"Invalid deposit amount.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    account = BankAccount(\"12345678\", 1000)\n",
    "    account.deposit(500)  # Output: Deposited 500. New balance: 1500\n",
    "    print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
