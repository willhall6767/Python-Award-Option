    "### Week 2: Control Structures – If Statements and Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lesson Objectives:\n",
    "- Understand the concept of control structures and their role in decision-making and repetition.\n",
    "- Learn to use conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to make decisions in a program.\n",
    "- Write Python programs using both count-controlled (`for`) and condition-controlled (`while`) loops.\n",
    "- Combine control structures with functions to create dynamic programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Conditional Statements:\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Used to make decisions based on conditions.\n",
    "- **Syntax**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if condition:\n",
    "        # Code block executed if condition is True\n",
    "    elif another_condition:\n",
    "        # Code block executed if the first condition is False and this condition is True\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # Code block executed if all above conditions are False\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "    if age < 18:\n",
    "        print(\"You are a minor.\")\n",
    "    elif age == 18:\n",
    "        print(\"Congratulations on adulthood!\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Relational and Logical Operators:\n",
    "- Relational operators: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`\n",
    "- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    x = 10\n",
    "    y = 5\n",
    "    if x > y and x < 20:\n",
    "        print(\"x is between y and 20.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. For Loops (Count-Controlled):\n",
    "- Used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., a list, range, or string).\n",
    "- **Syntax**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    for variable in sequence:\n",
    "        # Code block executed for each item in the sequence\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    for i in range(5):  # Iterates from 0 to 4\n",
    "        print(f\"Iteration {i}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. While Loops (Condition-Controlled):\n",
    "- Executes as long as a condition is `True`.\n",
    "- **Syntax**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    while condition:\n",
    "        # Code block executed repeatedly while condition is True\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Basic Example**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    while count < 5:\n",
    "        print(f\"Count is {count}\")\n",
    "        count += 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Using `break` to Exit the Loop Early**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    while count < 10:\n",
    "        if count == 5:\n",
    "            break  # Exit the loop when count reaches 5\n",
    "        print(f\"Count is {count}\")\n",
    "        count += 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Using `continue` to Skip to the Next Iteration**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    while count < 5:\n",
    "        count += 1\n",
    "        if count == 3:\n",
    "            continue  # Skip the rest of the loop when count is 3\n",
    "        print(f\"Count is {count}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Using `return` to Exit from a Function (with a While Loop)**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def find_number(numbers, target):\n",
    "        index = 0\n",
    "        while index < len(numbers):\n",
    "            if numbers[index] == target:\n",
    "                return f\"Found {target} at index {index}\"  # Exit the function\n",
    "            index += 1\n",
    "        return \"Not found\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(find_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3))  # Example call\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Combining Control Structures:\n",
    "- Using `if` statements within loops or loops within loops to solve more complex problems.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "        if i % 2 == 0:\n",
    "            print(f\"{i} is even\")\n",
